# HotShop Developer Guide

---

## Introduction

Welcome to the HotShop Developer Guide. This guide introduces the architecture,
codebase, and development workflow of HotShop, a JavaFX desktop marketplace with
local SQLite storage.

Start with [Development Workflow](developerGuide/DevelopmentWorkflow.html) to set
up your environment, run checks, and build the application. Then read
[Architecture Overview](developerGuide/ArchitectureOverview.html) to understand
how the application is organised. Use the sidebar to explore each topic in detail.

## Purpose of this Guide

The main objectives of this guide are to:

1. Orient developers to the codebase structure, application lifecycle, and
   responsibilities of each architectural layer.
2. Explain the [JavaFX UI](developerGuide/JavaFXUI.html),
   [Service Worker](developerGuide/ServiceWorker.html),
   and feature services.
3. Provide a reference for environment setup, dependencies, development checks,
   packaging, and engineering tools.

Proposed features and enhancements are documented separately in
[Future Work](developerGuide/FutureWork.html).

### Development verification

The full test suite takes more than ten minutes on a typical laptop, mostly
because each test account's password is hashed with 600,000 PBKDF2 iterations.
Run the targeted checks below while developing and the full suite before
committing.

Targeted development checks:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat test --tests hotshop.service.AccountServiceTest
.\gradlew.bat test --tests hotshop.service.ProfileImageTest
.\gradlew.bat test --tests "hotshop.service.Listing*"
.\gradlew.bat test --tests hotshop.service.OfferServiceTest
.\gradlew.bat test --tests hotshop.service.TransactionServiceTest
.\gradlew.bat test --tests hotshop.service.MeetupServiceTest --tests "hotshop.model.Meetup*"
.\gradlew.bat test --tests hotshop.service.ChatServiceTest --tests hotshop.model.ConversationTest --tests hotshop.model.MessageTest
.\gradlew.bat test --tests hotshop.storage.ImageStorageTest
.\gradlew.bat test --tests hotshop.ApplicationRuntimeTest --tests hotshop.database.DatabaseTest
```
